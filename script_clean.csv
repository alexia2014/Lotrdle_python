BILBO;There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo BagginsNow, where to begin? Ah, yesConcerning Hobbits;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO; Frodo, someone at the doorIn fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits, only real passion is for food., A rather unfair observation, As we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales,and the smoking of pipeweed But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quietand good tilled earthFor all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint, But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO;Frodo, the door! sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO;Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.;The Fellowship of the Ring

BILBO;Yes, yes.;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO;I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In fact, I mean not to.;The Fellowship of the Ring

BILBO;Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk Middle Earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted amongst the very wise;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO;And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has this past age Full of its own comings and goings with change coming slowly, if it comes at allFor things are made to endure in the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO; No thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations;The Fellowship of the Ring
BILBO;you've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we?ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and There's some cheese here, oh no that wont do!

BOROMIR;We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city;The Fellowship of the Ring
BOROMIR;One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful. Tis a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this.,It is folly;The Fellowship of the Ring

GALADRIEL;It began with the forging of the Great Rings;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;Three were given to the elvesImmortal, wisest and fairest of all beings., Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.,And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men Who above all else, desire power;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race But they were all of them deceivedFor another ring was made In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom (, the dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ringto control all others and into this Ring he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life One Ring to rule them all;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted A last alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;Victory was near But the power of the Ring could not be undone;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;It was in this moment, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth was defeated The Ring passed to Isildur., Who had this one chance to destroy evil forever But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted., And the Ring of Power has a will of its own;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;It betrayed Isildurto his deathAnd some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.,History became legend, legend became myth,and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge Until, when chance came, It ensnared a new bearer;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains And there it consumed him.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GALADRIEL;The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave it waited Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear And the Ring of Power perceived Its time had now come It abandoned Gollum., But something happened then that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable;The Fellowship of the Ring

GANDALF;His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing., He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground, before he sees a King return to the throne of men.

GANDALF;Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of The Shire!;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;I've no memory of this place;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Indeed?;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Oh really?;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;It's Gollum;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;He's been following us for three days;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Escaped or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story, Yes, he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill, before this is over., The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.,Oh! Its that way;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;So am I dear boy So am I.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;And what about very old friends?;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Bilbo Baggins;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;it's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old who would believe it You Haven't aged a day!;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Just tea, thank you.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Owwwh!;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF; No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Let me risk a little more light Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Gimli;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria., He is dead then., Its as I feared.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF; They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums, Drums in the deep. We cannot get out A shadow moves in the dark.,We cannot get out. They are coming.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF; Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Just tea, thank you.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;Oh not at all!;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;So you mean to go through with your plan then?;The Fellowship of the Ring

GANDALF;Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?;The Return of the King
GANDALF;He's very fond of you.;The Fellowship of the Ring
GANDALF;And what did you tell him? Speak;The Return of the King
GANDALF;What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?;The Return of the King
GANDALF;There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the RingWe?ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;No!;The Return of the King
GANDALF;They will be You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith and I wont be going alone.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Three days ride as the Nazgl flies. And you?d better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.;The Return of the King

GANDALF;Pippin.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Get up;The Return of the King
GANDALF;They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city., Help must come to us.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;You cannot pass;The Two Towers
GANDALF;I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.,Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!;The Two Towers

GANDALF;Amon D?n.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;Thank you.;The Return of the King
GANDALF;There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope. Our enemy is ready. His full strength's gathered. Not only orcs, but men as well, Legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast All will answer Mordor's call.;The Return of the King
